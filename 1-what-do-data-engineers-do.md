### If I am hired to enable data analytics in a company, where would I start?

I believe this is a question that every data engineer/analytics engineer/data analyst should be able to answer.

Personally, I would start from collecting key infomation about the business I am going to work with:

* What is the business-area of the company?
* How large it is in terms of the number of data-consumers? What are the categories of data-consumers?
* How much data does the company have, how much data it interacts with and what is this data?
* What is the level of current data environment? Does it require total reconstruction from scratch or only precise alterations are needed?
* How big are financial and human resources of the business? Which solutions can we afford to be in the borders of the budget?
